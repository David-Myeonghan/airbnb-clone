# Airbnb Clone

Cloning Airbnb with Python, Django, Tailwind and more...

A project consists of several applications.
Airbnb = Room Management + Review + Users + etc.

Describe an application in one sentence, not using 'and'.
Divide and Conquer.

Create several applications first.

- An application name should be plural, not singular. (rooms, users, reviews, conversations, lists, reservations)

User application substitues the default admin
